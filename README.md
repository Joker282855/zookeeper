users to look up animals that are in the current database and any zookeeper as part of the application

# Module Tasks

2. As a user I can add a zookeepers information 
3. As a user I can look up the current animals at the zoo
4. As a user I can look up the current zookeepers at the zoo

The tasks were achieved by following the lessons in module 10 which showed me how to due object oriented programming 
and how to connect the database to the server

# Running The Applicaiton
To run the application you need to first install the software program Visual Studio Code. Look up Visual Studio Code in google and download
the version of the software that is specfic to your computer. After installing Visual Studio Code Node.js will have to be installed on your 
computer as well. After both of these are installed on your computer follow the link below to my github account for this repository
